Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to **learn from data** and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

## 🤖 What Is Machine Learning?

At its core, ML is about feeding data into algorithms that can learn patterns and make decisions or predictions based on new data.

There are three main types of ML:

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
3. **Reinforcement Learning**

## 🧠 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

| Feature               | Supervised Learning      | Unsupervised Learning    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Uses labeled data     | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                    |
| Main goal             | Predict outcomes         | Discover structure       |
| Example algorithm     | Linear Regression        | K-Means Clustering       |

## 💡 Sample Code

```python
# Train a basic classifier using Scikit-Learn
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

iris = datasets.load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))
